# SBA-308
A cafe website I made for Per Scholas test.
This website was made using HTML, CSS, and JS.
I based this website off of a tea room that I went to a few years ago.
I used pictures that I took from at that location, as well as pictures from another tea room for this project.
I made the background, logo, and menu on Canva.
There are four working pages on this website and some dummy pages.
Clicking on the logos will take you back to the main page.
There is a dropdown menu under the "menu" tab in the navigation bar. The only working page in that dropdown is "Afternoon Tea"
There are two forms and one table in this website.
